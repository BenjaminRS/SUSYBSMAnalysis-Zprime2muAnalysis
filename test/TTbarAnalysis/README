Input of this analysis is ntuples dumpered by NtupleDumper.
NtupleBase.h and NtupleBase.C are generated automatically by ROOT from TTree in those ntuples.
TTbarAnalysis is a class to get historgrams .
Configure.C is a file to contain some configurable variables and included in TTbarAnalysis.C
plotJetPerformance.C , plotMassByProcess.C and plotTTbarMass.C are plotting histograms combined from different samples.
NtupleUtilities.C contains some usefull functions which are invoked in TTbarAnalysis.
rootlogon.C is root startup macro. 
startRun.C is used to run this analysis.
